Message log:

- *Ronny*: The Magus sources can be public domain. I really hope nobody would be trying to base anything off the sources anyhow - it's really simple and would probably be better served by a re-write anyway.
- *Cong*: Public domain is a great choice; since public domain may not apply in all jurisdictions, would you like to use something like CC0 instead? https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/ It is equivalent to a public domain in places that accept it, and a waiver of all rights in those that don't.
- *Ronny*: CC0 is fine.
